<h2>Project desription</h2>
  <p>This project is a web page containing a login form, created exclusively using HTML5 and CSS. The login form consists of basic input fields for entering data,
  a submit button styled with a gradient, and a custom checkbox input. The appearance of the checkbox input changes depending on its state (hover, checked, unchecked),
  with simple animations between each state. Additionally, the page features a "Forgot Password" link, whose text changes color to a gradient when hovered over.</p>
  <p>Every element on the page, including the landscape, is created from basic HTML elements and styled accordingly using CSS. The landscape is composed of div 
    elements, styled using various techniques such as clip-path, border, linear and radial gradients, transparency, and masking. Elements are positioned on the page using the position: absolute and relative properties.</p>
  <p>This project aimed to learn the basic syntax of CSS and demonstrate how it can be used to create more complex elements.</p>
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
  <p>Throughout the creation of this project, I've learned:</p>
  <li>How to utilize linear and radial gradients to create background elements.</li>
  <li>Using clip-path to create elements with irregular shapes.</li>
  <li>Positioning elements on the page using position: absolute and relative.</li>
  <li>Creating custom checkboxes.</li>
  <li>Adding simple animations using transitions when changing the state of elements.</li>
  <li>Utilizing mask image to add gradient transparency to elements.</li>
  <li>Employing filters to manipulate the appearance of elements.</li>
  <br>
  <p>This project has provided me with valuable insights into styling and animating web pages, enhancing my understanding of CSS capabilities and fostering a more creative approach to user interface design.</p>
